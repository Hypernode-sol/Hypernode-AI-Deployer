# Hypernode-AI-Deployer

The **Hypernode AI Deployer** is the distributed layer of the Hypernode Network that enables users to **deploy, fine-tune, and host AI models** (LLMs, Vision, Speech, etc.) using decentralized GPU power from the network‚Äôs nodes.  
It transforms Hypernode into an **AI orchestration layer**, allowing anyone to train open-source models securely, efficiently, and at scale.

---

## üåê Core Concept

Users can:
1. Select an open-source model (e.g., **LLaMA 3**, **Mistral**, **Falcon**, **Stable Diffusion**);
2. Upload private or public datasets for fine-tuning;
3. The training job is distributed across GPU nodes in the Hypernode network;
4. Upon completion, the trained model is containerized and deployed via a secure API endpoint;
5. The network automatically handles reward distribution to the participating nodes in **$HYPER** tokens.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|                 Hypernode.AI-Deployer                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Model Registry & Catalog                               |
|    - Integrates with HuggingFace, Ollama, etc.            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 2. Training Orchestrator                                  |
|    - Manages distributed fine-tuning via Horovod/Ray      |
|    - Schedules tasks across GPU nodes                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 3. Telemetry Collector & Reward Adapter                   |
|    - Monitors GPU load, latency, and job completion        |
|    - Reports performance metrics for token distribution    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 4. Model Deployment Layer                                 |
|    - Packages models into Docker/OCI containers            |
|    - Deploys endpoints for inference                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 5. User Dashboard                                         |
|    - UI for job creation, tracking, and cost monitoring   |

## üß© Key Components

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `/core/model_registry.py` | Lists available models and manages imports from HuggingFace or Ollama. |
| `/core/job_scheduler.py` | Allocates distributed tasks among nodes with GPUs. |
| `/core/training_orchestrator.py` | Coordinates parallel fine-tuning operations and checkpointing. |
| `/core/telemetry_collector.py` | Monitors GPU usage, latency, and throughput. |
| `/core/reward_manager_adapter.py` | Connects training telemetry with the Reward Distribution Manager. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Process

1. User selects model and uploads dataset.  
2. `job_scheduler.py` distributes the training job across GPU nodes.  
3. `training_orchestrator.py` performs synchronized fine-tuning (Horovod / Ray).  
4. Metrics are sent to the `telemetry_collector.py` and stored for audit.  
5. Once finished, the model is packaged by `model_registry.py` and deployed.  
6. Rewards are calculated and sent via `reward_manager_adapter.py`.

---

## üí∞ Incentive Model

Each GPU node is rewarded based on:
- GPU-time consumed
- Model throughput
- Uptime & reliability
- Node latency

All values are reported through the telemetry layer and automatically translated into **$HYPER** payouts.

---

## üìä API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `/api/deploy_model` | Deploy a new training job. |
| `/api/list_models` | Retrieve available base models. |
| `/api/get_job_status` | Get job progress, logs, and checkpoints. |
| `/api/user_dashboard` | Web interface for monitoring deployments. |

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- Training jobs are sandboxed within isolated containers.  
- Uploaded datasets are encrypted and only accessible during the training phase.  
- Telemetry data is anonymized before broadcast to the reward system.  

---

## üß≠ Future Roadmap

- Integration with **AI Agent Marketplace**
- Proof-of-Training using Zero-Knowledge proofs
- Cross-chain deployment (Base / Arbitrum / Cosmos)
- Reputation system for GPU nodes
